Wearing a mask presents a barrier for the spread of both TB and COVID-19 as masks stop them from being distributed into the air if being worn by someone who has symptoms or being inhaled by or touched by others in the immediate environment.

Masks have been used in TB infection prevention and control for many years to reduce the risk of further spread of TB amongst family members of the affected person, the community and healthcare workers. For TB, as there is an effective treatment available, once a person is on the right treatment the risk of infecting others rapidly decreases and there is often no need to wear a mask.

For COVID-19, the WHO recommends that masks be worn by persons with symptoms but discourages healthy people from wearing masks in general. There is some evidence from China that voluntary wearing of masks by healthy or asymptomatic people in the community can help decrease the spread of COVID-19.

Mask wearing is part of a package of infection prevention and control interventions, and in isolation is likely to have a minimal impact on the transmission of TB or COVID-19. If you are at risk and in a high burden context (for either TB or COVID-19), adding mask-wearing to regular hand washing, social distancing, and cough hygiene practices may offer additional protection.
