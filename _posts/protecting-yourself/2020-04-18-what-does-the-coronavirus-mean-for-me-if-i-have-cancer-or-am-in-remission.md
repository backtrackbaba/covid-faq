The coronavirus is new, and research is still developing on this virus and its effect on cancer patients. At the moment, there is limited data on whether patients with cancer or those who are receiving treatments that suppress their immune system, such as chemotherapy, could be more severely affected. Patients who are undergoing active treatment for cancer are presumably at higher risk than those who are in remission.

The Abramson Cancer Center at Penn Medicine is providing care in the safest setting for all of our cancer patients â€“ whether you newly diagnosed, on treatment or in follow-up care. We have put together information on what to do if you or a family member develops COVID-19 symptoms, cancer treatments and procedures, how we're ensuring the hospitals and cancer clinics are safe for patients, and more.
