Preterm birth and other adverse infant outcomes have been reported in mothers who tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy. However, this information is based on limited data, and it is not clear if these outcomes were related to the motherâ€™s infection.

It is also unclear if COVID-19 can cross through placenta and infect an unborn child. In a recent (limited) study of infants born to mothers who had COVID-19, none of the infants tested positive for COVID-19, according to ACOG. The virus also was not found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk, according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fprepare%2Fpregnancy-breastfeeding.html).
