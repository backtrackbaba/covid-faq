As COVID-19 is so new, there are no data currently on if those with or who have a previous history of TB are more at risk of worse outcomes. However, COVID-19 affects the lungs, and as we know that there is usually some left-over damage in the lungs following TB disease, which may put you at increased risk of developing more severe COVID-19 symptoms.

People who have had TB, particularly those who may have required lung surgery or who have been diagnosed with post-TB lung disease should consider limiting their exposure to high risk environments - this depends on your national situation with regards to the likelihood of COVID-19 circulating in your community. The key ways to protect yourself from COVID-19 include:

Regular hand-washing using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub
Social distancing - maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
Good respiratory hygiene by covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze, then disposing of the used tissue immediately.
Avoid touching your face, mouth or eyes
In addition to the advice regarding regular handwashing, regular cleaning of surfaces and practicing social distancing measures, some of the ways to protect yourself include keeping in good general health. It has been shown that tobacco use (including tobacco smoking, vaping and using e-cigarettes) are at an increased risk of developing a more severe COVID-19 disease. If you do use tobacco products, it would be recommended to stop â€“ this will not only protect you from severe COVID-19 disease but will be good for your lung health in general and also protect you from TB.
