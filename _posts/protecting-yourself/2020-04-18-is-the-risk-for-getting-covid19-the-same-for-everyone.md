No, but as the virus spreads, it affects multiple age groups. People in high-risk groups for getting very sick from COVID‑19 include people 65 years and older and those with chronic medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and cancer. Those who have a compromised immune system are also at higher risk than those in the general population.

If you are in one of the higher-risk groups mentioned above and you develop fever or symptoms, call your doctor. If you are not sick enough to be hospitalized, you can recover at home.
