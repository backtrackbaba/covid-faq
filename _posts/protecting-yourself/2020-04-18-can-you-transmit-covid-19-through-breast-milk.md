Currently, experts believe that the person-to-person spread of COVID-19 happens when someone with the infection coughs or sneezes â€” similarly to how the flu and other respiratory viruses spread.

Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for most infants. You should work with your doctor to make the personal decision of whether and how to start or continue breastfeeding.

If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the CDC recommends the following precautions to avoid spreading the virus to your infant:

Wash your hands before touching your baby.
Wear a facemask, if possible, while breastfeeding.
Wash your hands before touching or expressing breast milk with breast pump, and make sure your pump is clean before and after each use.
If possible, consider having someone who is not sick feed your expressed breast milk to your baby.
