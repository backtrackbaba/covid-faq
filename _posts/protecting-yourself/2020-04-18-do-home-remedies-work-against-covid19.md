Home remedies and therapies are not proven to help alleviate symptoms nor ensure you won't get it. That's why it is important to focus on prevention: always practice good hygiene and stay away from sick people. Eating healthy, regular physical exercise, good sleep and lowering stress levels are great ways to keep your immune system healthy.
