If you’re pregnant, you should do the same things as the general public to avoid infection. The best way to prevent illness is to do the following:

Practice “social distancing”: Avoid all gatherings with large numbers of people.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.

Clean and disinfect high-touch objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.
