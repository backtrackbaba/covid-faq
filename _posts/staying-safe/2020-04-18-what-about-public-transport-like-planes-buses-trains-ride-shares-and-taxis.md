Non-essential travel is to be avoided.
The Government recommends that employers offer flexible working arrangements to minimise
the number of people catching public transport at any one time. Long distance services carry a
higher risk of infection and should be reconsidered at this time.
If possible sit in the back seat of taxis and ride share vehicles.
Group transport of at-risk people, including older people should be avoided where possible.
