In an effort to protect our patients and staff, and to prioritize the needs of those who may require immediate care, we have been rescheduling some patient appointments and procedures. We will contact you directly if your outpatient visit, procedure, or surgery is postponed until a later date.

Our first priority is always the safety of our patients. We are working to move some patients to virtual visits and home care, as appropriate. During this time, all Penn Medicine facilities will remain open in order to care for patients who require in-person visits and time sensitive care. Patients who have specific concerns about their health or personal situation should contact their health care provider for more guidance.
