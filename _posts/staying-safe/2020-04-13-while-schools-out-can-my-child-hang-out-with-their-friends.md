- The key to slowing the spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. While school is out, children should not have in-person playdates with children from other households. If children are playing outside their own homes, it is essential that they remain 6 feet from anyone who is not in their own household.

- To help children maintain social connections while social distancing, help your children have supervised phone calls or video chats with their friends.

- Make sure children practice [everyday preventive behaviors](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html), such as washing their hands often with soap and water.   
	Remember, if children meet outside of school in groups, it can put everyone at risk.
		- Revise spring break plans if they included non-essential travel.

- Information about [COVID-19 in children ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html)is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may have only mild symptoms. However, they can still pass this virus onto others who may be at higher risk, including [older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html).
