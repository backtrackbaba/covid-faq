Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:

**Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.**

When to Seek Medical Attention
If you develop any of these **emergency warning signs** for COVID-19 **get medical attention immediately**:

* Trouble breathing
* Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
* New confusion or inability to arouse
* Bluish lips or face

**This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.**

**Call your Local Authrities if you have a medical emergency**: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have, COVID-19. If possible, put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.


* Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
* If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
* Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others.
* Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
* Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks.
