[Older adults and people who have serious underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html) are at highest risk of getting sick from COVID-19.

- If others in your home are at particularly [high risk for severe illness from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html), consider extra precautions to separate your child from those people.

- If you are unable to stay home with your child during school dismissals, carefully consider who might be best positioned to provide childcare. If someone at higher risk for COVID-19 will be providing care (older adult, such as a grandparent or someone with a serious underlying medical condition), limit your children’s contact with other people.

- Consider postponing visits or trip to see older family members and grandparents. Connect virtually or by writing letters and sending via mail.
