Social distancing involves staying away from other people to avoid catching or spreading a virus. It's a fancy term for avoiding crowds and minimizing physical contact. This could mean avoiding concerts or weddings, skipping the handshake, and/or staying six feet from others. Health professionals believe COVIDâ€‘19 spreads from person to person by droplets from coughing and sneezing. The safest thing to do during an outbreak is stay home as much as possible and minimize close contact with others.
