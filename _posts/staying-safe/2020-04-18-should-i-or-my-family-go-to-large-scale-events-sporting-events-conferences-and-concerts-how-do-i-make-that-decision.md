We all want to go about our daily lives as normally as possible. But organizations are canceling and rescheduling events like conferences, rodeos and festivals. If you are considering attending a large gathering, consider your personal risk of getting and spreading the virus. If you are age 65 or older, or have a chronic medical condition, you need to be very thoughtful about your risk. Then decide for yourself whether you want to attend.
