Talk to the [school or facility](https://www.cdc.govhttps//www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/guidance-for-schools.html) about their emergency operations plan. Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a[ college or university](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/colleges-universities/index.html), encourage them to learn about the school’s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
