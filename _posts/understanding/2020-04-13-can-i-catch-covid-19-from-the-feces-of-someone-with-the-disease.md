The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
 appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a 
main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
after using the bathroom and before eating.
