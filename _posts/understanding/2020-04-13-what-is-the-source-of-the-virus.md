COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and may different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people. This occurred with [MERS-CoV](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html) and [SARS-CoV](https://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html), and now with the virus that causes COVID-19. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the [Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/summary.html#emergence).
