The following measures **ARE NOT** effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:

- Smoking
- Wearing multiple masks
- Taking antibiotics (See the answer to ["Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?"](/medical-advice/are-there-any-medicines-or-therapies-that-can-prevent-or-cure-covid-19/))

**In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early** to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider.
