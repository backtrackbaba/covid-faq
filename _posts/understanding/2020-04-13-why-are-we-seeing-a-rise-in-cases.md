The [number of cases of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) being reported in the United States is rising due to [increased laboratory testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html) and reporting across the country. The growing number of cases in part reflects the rapid spread of COVID-19 as many U.S. states and territories experience community spread. More detailed and accurate data will allow us to better understand and track the size and scope of the outbreak and strengthen prevention and response efforts.
