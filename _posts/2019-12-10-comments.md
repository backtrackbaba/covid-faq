Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post. To enable it, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
disqus:
    shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`. If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.
