```yml
# Categories are separated into sections
- title: Getting Started
  subtitle:
  category: setup
  categories:

    - permalink: /setup/basics/
      title: Basic Setup
      desc: Get started fast with installation and theme setup instructions
      icon: cog

    - permalink: /setup/content/
      title: Managing Content
      desc: Get help or tailor the theme to your specific requirements
      icon: file-text
      
- title: Customization
  subtitle:
  category: customization
  categories:

    - permalink: /customization/development/
      title: Development

    - permalink: /customization/help/
      title: Sources & Help

The permalinks have to match the permalink set in `categories/my-category.md` files.

Add boxes section to a page using the following include:
{% raw %}
```yaml
{% include categories.html 
  columns="3" 
  section="muted" 
%}
```
{% endraw %}
