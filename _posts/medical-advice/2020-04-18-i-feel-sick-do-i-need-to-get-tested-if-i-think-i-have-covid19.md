Your doctor will help make the decision whether you need to get tested, based on your symptoms and risk category. Symptoms of COVID‑19 may show up 2–14 days after exposure and may include fever, cough and shortness of breath. If you are age 65 or older and/or have other medical problems like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, or cancer — and have fever or symptoms — call your doctor. If you are not sick enough to be hospitalized, you can recover at home. If you are in generally good health and you get sick, stay home and take care of yourself like you would for the flu. If your symptoms worsen, call your doctor.
