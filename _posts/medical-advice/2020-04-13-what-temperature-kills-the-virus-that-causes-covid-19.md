Generally coronaviruses survive for shorter periods at higher temperatures and higher humidity than in cooler or dryer environments. However, we don’t have direct data for this virus, nor do we have direct data for a temperature-based cutoff for inactivation at this point. The necessary temperature would also be based on the materials of the surface, the environment, etc. Regardless of temperature please follow [CDC’s guidance for cleaning and disinfection](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/disinfecting-your-home.html).
