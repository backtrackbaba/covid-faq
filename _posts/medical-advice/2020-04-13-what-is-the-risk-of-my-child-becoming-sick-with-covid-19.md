Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 at [People who are at higher risk for severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/people-at-higher-risk.html).
