No, it is not safe to go on a cruise. Cruises put large numbers of people, often from countries around the world, in frequent and close contact with each other. 

Sustained community spread of COVID-19 has been associated with several recent cruise events. In addition, those traveling by ship may be impacted by travel restrictions affecting their itineraries or ability to disembark, or may be subject to quarantine procedures implemented by the local authorities.

The CDC has implemented a No Sail Order for cruise ships effective March 14, 2020, lasting for the next 30 days
