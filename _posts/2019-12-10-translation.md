Set your language code in `_config.yml`:
```yml
lang: en
```
Theme strings can be translated in `_data/translation.yml`, copy the current English translation and paste it bellow the Eglish translation, then replace `en` with you language code that you set in `_config.yml` and translate the strings.

```yml
en:
  previous:                   "Previous"
